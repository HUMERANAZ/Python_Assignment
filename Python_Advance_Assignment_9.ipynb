    "\n",
    "2. **Newline Handling**: Text-mode files handle newline characters differently depending on the platform. On Windows, the newline is represented as a carriage return followed by a line feed (`\\r\\n`), while on Unix and Mac OS X, the newline is represented as a line feed (`\\n`). In text-mode files, the newline handling is done automatically. In binary-mode files, newlines are not automatically translated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Read and Write Operations**: Text-mode files can be read and written using the `read()` and `write()` methods. These methods deal with the text data and perform encoding and decoding automatically. Binary-mode files, on the other hand, can be read and written using the `read()` and `write()` methods, but they deal with binary data and do not perform any encoding or decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seeking**: Text-mode files can be seeked to a specific byte offset, but not to a specific character offset. Binary-mode files can be seeked to both byte and character offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **File Mode**: The file mode for text-mode files is specified with the letter \"t\" (e.g. \"rt\" for read text mode). The file mode for binary-mode files is specified with the letter \"b\" (e.g. \"rb\" for read binary mode)."
