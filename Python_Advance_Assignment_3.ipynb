    "An abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be subclassed, but not instantiated directly. It serves as a template or blueprint for other classes, defining a common set of methods and properties that are shared by its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an abstract superclass is to provide a common interface and behavior for a group of related classes. By defining a set of methods and properties that are required for all subclasses, it can ensure that all subclasses behave consistently and can be used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an abstract superclass can be defined using the `abc` module, which provides a set of tools for defining and working with abstract classes. An abstract class is defined using the `ABC` class as a base class, and at least one abstract method must be defined using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. Any subclass of the abstract class must implement all the abstract methods defined in the superclass, or it will itself become an abstract class.\n",
