    "#### 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shutil.copy()` and `shutil.copytree()` functions in the `shutil` module are used for different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copy(src, dst)` is used to copy a single file from the source location (`src`) to the destination location (`dst`). It preserves the file's metadata, including permissions, timestamps, and other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shutil.copytree(src, dst)` is used to recursively copy an entire directory tree from the source location (`src`) to the destination location (`dst`). It creates a new directory at the destination and replicates the structure and contents of the source directory, including all its subdirectories and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `shutil.copy()` is used for copying individual files, while `shutil.copytree()` is used for copying directories and their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What function is used to rename files?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `os.rename()` function is used to rename files in Python. It is part of the `os` module and allows you to change the name of a file or move it to a different location while keeping it within the same filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of `os.rename()` is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "os.rename(src, dst)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `src` represents the original file path, and `dst` represents the new name or new path of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `send2trash` and `shutil` modules provide different mechanisms for deleting files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `send2trash` module provides a `send2trash()` function that moves files and directories to the system's trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them. It acts as a safer alternative to `os.remove()` or `shutil.rmtree()`, allowing files to be easily recovered if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `shutil` module provides various functions for file and directory operations, including `shutil.rmtree()` which is used to recursively delete directories and their contents. Unlike `send2trash()`, `shutil.rmtree()` deletes files and directories permanently without moving them to the trash.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `send2trash` provides a way to move files and directories to the trash or recycle bin, while `shutil` allows for direct deletion of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ZipFile` method `open()` is equivalent to the `open()` method of file objects. It is used to open a file within a ZIP archive and return a file-like object that can be used to read or write data from/to that specific file within the archive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "\n",
    "with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as myzip:\n",
    "    with myzip.open('file.txt', 'r') as myfile:\n",
    "        content = myfile.read()\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, `myzip.open('file.txt', 'r')` opens the file named 'file.txt' within the 'example.zip' archive in read mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example program that searches a folder tree for files with a specific file extension (such as '.pdf' or '.jpg') and copies them to a new folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "def copy_files_with_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, extension):\n",
    "    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_folder):\n",
    "        for file in files:\n",
    "            if file.endswith(extension):\n",
    "                source_path = os.path.join(root, file)\n",
    "                destination_path = os.path.join(destination_folder, file)\n",
    "                shutil.copy(source_path, destination_path)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "source_folder = 'path/to/source/folder'\n",
    "destination_folder = 'path/to/destination/folder'\n",
    "extension = '.pdf'\n",
    "\n",
    "copy_files_with_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, extension)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above program, `copy_files_with_extension()` is a function that takes the source\n",
    "folder, destination folder, and the desired file extension as parameters. It uses `os.walk()` to traverse the directory tree, searches for files with the specified extension using `file.endswith()`, and copies them to the destination folder using `shutil.copy()`."
