    "The `assert` statement in Python is used to assert that a certain condition is true. If the condition is false, the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError` with an optional error message.\n",

    "```\n",
    "assert condition, [error_message]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` is the expression that is being asserted to be true, and the `error_message` is an optional message that can be included in the `AssertionError` if the assertion fails. If the `condition` is true, then the `assert` statement does nothing and execution continues normally. However, if the `condition` is false, then the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError` with the optional `error_message`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assert` statement is similar to the `if` statement in that it allows you to test for certain conditions and take appropriate action based on the results. However, the `assert` statement is different from the `if` statement in that it is typically used to check for conditions that should never occur in a correctly written program. In other words, `assert` is used to catch programming errors rather than to handle normal runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another statement that is similar to `assert` is the `raise` statement, which is used to raise an exception when a certain condition is met. Both `assert` and `raise` are used for error handling and to make sure that problems in a program are detected and handled appropriately."
