    "#### Q1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "A1. The `float` class in Python represents floating-point numbers using the native binary format of the underlying system. It offers high precision for most everyday calculations but can suffer from limited precision and rounding errors. On the other hand, the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module provides a decimal floating-point representation with user-defined precision and control over rounding. `Decimal` is suitable for financial and monetary calculations where accuracy and precision are crucial, but it can be slower and consumes more memory compared to `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states?\n",
    "A2. In terms of object identity, Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are distinct objects and have different internal states. They are not the same object. However, they represent the same mathematical value, with both instances of Decimal representing the number 1.2 with different internal precision and formatting. The differences in internal states may not be apparent when comparing their mathematical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. What happens if the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked?\n",
    "A3. If the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked using the `==` operator, the result will be `True`. Despite having different internal states, the Decimal class overrides the equality comparison operator to compare the mathematical values represented by the instances rather than their internal states. Thus, the comparison considers the numerical value and not the internal precision or formatting differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4. Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value?\n",
    "A4. It is preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value because floating-point numbers can suffer from precision and rounding issues. When a floating-point value is used to initialize a Decimal object directly, it may introduce rounding errors or imprecise representations due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic. Starting with a string representation, such as '1.200', ensures that the Decimal object accurately captures the intended decimal value without any loss of precision during the conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q5. In an arithmetic phrase, how simple is it to combine Decimal objects with integers?\n",
    "A5. Combining Decimal objects with integers in arithmetic operations is straightforward and seamless. The Decimal class in Python allows arithmetic operations between Decimal objects and integers without any explicit conversion. The Decimal arithmetic automatically handles the precision and scale of the numbers involved, ensuring accurate results. This simplicity and compatibility make Decimal objects and integers easily combinable in arithmetic expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q6. Can Decimal objects and floating-point values be combined easily?\n",
    "A6. Decimal objects and floating-point values can be combined in arithmetic operations, but caution is required due to the inherent differences between the representations. When a Decimal object and a floating-point value are combined, the floating-point value is implicitly converted to a Decimal object before the operation. However, this conversion may introduce potential rounding errors and imprecise results due to the limited precision of floating-point numbers. It is recommended to use Decimal objects consistently for precise calculations involving decimal numbers to avoid such issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7. Using the Fraction class but not the Decimal class, give an example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision.\n",
    "A7. The Fraction class in Python allows exact representation of rational numbers without any loss of precision. An example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision using the Fraction class is the fraction `Fraction(1, 3)`. The Fraction object precisely captures the ratio of one-third without any rounding or approximation, providing absolute precision in representing the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q8. Describe a quantity that can be accurately expressed by the Decimal or Fraction classes but not by a floating-point value.\n",
    "A8. Decimal and Fraction classes can accurately represent quantities that involve recurring or non-terminating decimal expansions. For example, the value of Ï€ (pi) can be accurately represented using the Decimal or Fraction class, but it cannot be expressed precisely using a floating-point value due to its infinite and non-repeating decimal representation. The Decimal and Fraction classes offer arbitrary precision and can handle such numbers accurately, making them suitable for precise mathematical calculations involving such quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q9. Consider the following two fraction objects: Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10). Is the internal state of these two objects the same? Why do you think that is?\n",
    "A9. Yes, the internal state of the two fraction objects `Fraction(1, 2)` and `Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10)` is the same. The fractions represent the same mathematical value of 0.5, and their internal states would be identical. The Fraction class automatically simplifies fractions by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). As a result, the fractions with different representations, such as `Fraction(1, 2)` and `Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10)`, are reduced to the same simplified form of `Fraction(1, 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q10. How do the Fraction class and the integer type (int) relate to each other? Containment or inheritance?\n",
    "A10. The Fraction class and the integer type (int) in Python are related through containment. The Fraction class is not a subclass of the int class nor does it inherit directly from int. However, the Fraction class can represent integers exactly, as fractions with a denominator of 1. In other words, integers can be considered a special case of fractions where the denominator is 1. The Fraction class provides methods and operations that allow seamless interaction between fractions and integers, making it possible to perform arithmetic operations and comparisons between them."
