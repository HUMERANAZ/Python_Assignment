    "Both def statements and lambda expressions in Python are used to define functions. However, they have some differences in their syntax and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A def statement is used to define a function with a name, parameters, and a block of code that executes when the function is called. The syntax for a def statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    # block of code\n",
    "    return value\n",

    "On the other hand, a lambda expression is an anonymous function that can be defined in a single line of code. It does not require a name or a return statement. The syntax for a lambda expression is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lambda parameters: expression\n",
    "```\n",

    "The benefits of using lambda expressions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Concise code: Lambda expressions provide a more concise way to define simple functions. They can be defined in a single line of code and do not require a function name or return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Readability: Lambda expressions can make the code more readable by reducing the number of lines of code and by making it clear that the function is being defined for a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility: Lambda expressions can be used in a variety of contexts, including as arguments to higher-order functions, as keys in dictionaries, and as values in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Speed: Because lambda expressions are defined inline, they can be faster to execute than equivalent functions defined using def statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No namespace pollution: Since lambda expressions do not require a function name, they do not pollute the namespace with an unnecessary name. This is useful in cases where the function is only used once or is not needed after it has been defined."
