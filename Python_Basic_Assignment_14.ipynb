    "#### 1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model that represents colors using combinations of red, green, and blue components along with an alpha component that represents the opacity or transparency of the color. Each component value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents no intensity and 255 represents maximum intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the RGBA value of an image using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the `getpixel()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "rgba_value = image.getpixel((x, y))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(rgba_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `image.getpixel((x, y))` retrieves the RGBA value of the pixel at coordinates `(x, y)` in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work? \n",
    "\n",
    "A box tuple is a tuple that represents a rectangular region or box in an image. It is defined as `(left, upper, right, lower)`, where `left` represents the x-coordinate of the left edge, `upper` represents the y-coordinate of the upper edge, `right` represents the x-coordinate of the right edge, and `lower` represents the y-coordinate of the lower edge. The box tuple is used to specify regions of interest or define areas for cropping or pasting in Pillow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out the width and height of an Image object in Pillow, you can use the `size` attribute. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "width, height = image.size\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Width: {width}, Height: {height}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `image.size` returns a tuple containing the width and height of the image, which are then assigned to the variables `width` and `height`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an Image object for a 100x100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can use the `crop()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "cropped_image = image.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))\n",
    "\n",
    "cropped_image.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `image.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))` creates a cropped Image object by specifying the box tuple `(0, 0, 50, 50)`, which represents the region excluding the lower-left quarter of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "\n",
    "After making changes to an Image object in Pillow, you can save it as an image file using the `save()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform operations on the image\n",
    "\n",
    "image.save('output.jpg')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `image.save('output.jpg')` saves the modified Image object as an image file named 'output.jpg'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "\n",
    "The module that contains Pillow's shape-drawing code is `PIL.ImageDraw`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Image objects in Pillow do not have drawing methods. To perform drawing operations such as drawing shapes, lines, and text on an image, you need to create an ImageDraw object. You can get this object using the `ImageDraw.Draw()` function. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.new('RGB', (500, 500), 'white')\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform drawing operations using the draw object\n",
    "\n",
    "image.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `ImageDraw.Draw(image)` creates an ImageDraw object named `draw` for the `image` object, allowing you to perform drawing operations on the image."
