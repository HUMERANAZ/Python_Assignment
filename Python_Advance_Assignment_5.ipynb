    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In Python, a class can inherit from multiple parent classes by listing them in parentheses after the class name in the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a class that inherits from two parent classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent1:\n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Parent1 method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent2:\n",
    "    def method2(self):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Child` class inherits from both the `Parent1` and `Parent2` classes, and it can call methods from both parent classes. This can be useful when you want to reuse code from multiple sources, or when you want to create a class hierarchy that reflects the relationships between different types of objects. However, multiple inheritance can also make code more complex and harder to understand, so it should be used judiciously."

    "Delegation is a design pattern in object-oriented programming where an object passes responsibility for a particular task to another object.

    "\n",
    "Delegation can be useful in situations where you want to reuse code from another object but don't want to inherit from that object's class or modify its behavior.

This attribute cannot be accessed from outside the class using the dot notation (`obj.__x`), because Python automatically renames it to `_MyClass__x`. Therefore, attempting to access `obj.__x` raises an `AttributeError`.\n",
