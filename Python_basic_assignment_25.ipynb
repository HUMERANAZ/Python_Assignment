    "The `yield` statement is used in Python to define a generator function. When a `yield` statement is executed, it produces a value that can be returned to the caller without actually terminating the function. The function can be resumed from where it left off the next time it is called.\n",

This can be more efficient in terms of memory usage, since only the current value needs to be stored in memory at any given time.\n",

    "Both `map()` and list comprehensions are used in Python for performing operations on iterable objects like lists, tuples, or sets. However, there are some differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map()` is a built-in function that takes a function object and an iterable object as arguments and returns a new iterable object with the result of applying the function to each item in the iterable. In contrast, list comprehensions are a syntactic construct that allows you to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map()` always returns an iterable object, while list comprehensions always return a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- List comprehensions are often easier to read and more concise than using `map()` with a lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that shows the difference between using `map()` and a list comprehension to square each item in a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Using map() with a lambda function\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",

    "In general, list comprehensions are preferred over using `map()` because they are more readable and easier to understand. However, `map()` can be useful in certain cases, such as when you need to apply a function to multiple iterables at once."
