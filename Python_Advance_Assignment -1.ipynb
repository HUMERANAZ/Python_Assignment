    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to allow developers to create modular, reusable code that is easier to maintain and extend. OOP provides a way to organize code into objects, which can encapsulate data and behavior, making it easier to reason about the code and reduce its complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, OOP allows you to define classes, which are templates for creating objects. A class can define attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. Objects created from a class can have their own values for the attributes and can call the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the benefits of using OOP in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity: OOP allows you to break down a large problem into smaller, more manageable parts. Classes can be reused in different parts of the program or in different programs altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: OOP allows you to abstract away implementation details and focus on the high-level functionality of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: OOP allows you to encapsulate data and behavior into objects, making it easier to reason about the code and reducing the risk of unwanted interactions between different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance: OOP allows you to create new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods. This can help you avoid duplicating code and make it easier to make changes to the program in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism: OOP allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different implementations. This can make it easier to write code that works with different types of objects."

    "In Python, when an attribute is accessed on an object, the interpreter searches for the attribute in a specific order. This order is known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO), and it is determined by the inheritance hierarchy of the object's class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an attribute is accessed on an object, the interpreter first looks for the attribute in the object's own dictionary. If the attribute is not found there, it then looks for the attribute in the dictionary of the object's class. If the attribute is not found in the class, the interpreter continues the search up the inheritance hierarchy, checking each parent class in turn, until it finds the attribute or reaches the top of the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the search is determined by the MRO, which is a linear ordering of the classes in the inheritance hierarchy. Python uses a variant of the C3 linearization algorithm to compute the MRO, which ensures that the order is consistent with the following three principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depth First Search: A parent class is searched before its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Left-to-Right: When multiple parent classes are present, they are searched in the order in which they appear in the inheritance tuple.\n",

    "\n",
    "To distinguish between a class object and an instance object, you need to understand the following differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Definition: A class is defined using the `class` keyword, while an instance is created using the class constructor, which is typically the class name followed by parentheses.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Methods: A class has class-level methods that operate on class-level properties. An instance has instance-level methods that operate on instance-level properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Initialization: A class can define a special method called `__init__` that is called when a new instance is created. This method can be used to initialize the instance with default values. An instance is created by calling the class constructor and passing any necessary arguments.\n",
