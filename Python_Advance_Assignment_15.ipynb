    "Python 3.8 was released on October 14, 2019, and included several new features and optimizations. Some of the major new features in Python 3.8 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment Expressions (the Walrus operator): This allows you to assign values to variables within an expression. For example, you can write \"if (n := len(s)) > 10\" instead of \"n = len(s); if n > 10\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-only parameters: This allows you to specify function arguments that can only be passed positionally, not as keyword arguments. This can make function signatures clearer and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. f-strings now support the = format specifier: This allows you to format values using the = specifier, which adds leading zeros and spaces to align values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debug information is now included in traceback objects: This makes it easier to diagnose errors by providing more detailed information about where the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Improvements to the typing module: The typing module has been updated with new features like TypedDict and Literal, and several existing types have been optimized for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The multiprocessing module now supports the shared memory and semaphore types: This allows for easier sharing of data between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. New syntax for positional-only parameters in function definitions: You can now use / to specify that all parameters before it are positional-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Improved performance and optimizations: Several performance improvements and optimizations have been made, including faster start-up times and faster I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the new features in Python 3.8."

    "Monkey patching in Python refers to dynamically modifying or extending code at runtime, without altering the original source code. This can be done by directly modifying or replacing attributes or methods of an object or class with new implementations. Monkey patching can be useful in situations where it is not feasible or practical to modify the original source code, such as fixing a bug in a third-party library or adding new functionality to an existing module. However, it can also be a dangerous practice if not used carefully, as it can introduce unexpected behavior and make code harder to debug and maintain."

In other words, the new object references the same memory location as the original object. To create a shallow copy of an object in Python, you can use the `copy` module's `copy()` method.\n",
